# Retail_Return_Policy_Analysis
Analyzed effects of a change in a retailer's return policy.

Background: A retail company changed it's return policy by reducing the number of days customers had to make a return from 90 to 45 dayas, and would like to understand the effects on sales and returns. The transaction data is from an entire year. The policy change occured halfway through the year and only affected certain stores. The variable polchange is 0 for the first half of the year and 1 for the second half. The variable studygrp is 0 if the store did not change their return policy and 1 if the policy is changed. Therefore we look for significance in the interaction term between polchange and studygrp to determine if the new policy has an effect.
